1. Correlation of tests with interview-client:

For last technical campaigns:
correlation = 0.39
% of people accepted by client = 33%

For campaigns before that:
correlation = 0.022
% of people accepted by client = 23%

2. Correlaci√≥n entre puntaje y tiempo para contestar prueba.
3. Correlation between number of words in open fields and passing the interview, despite passing test
